# Teaching Mario to play Super Mario World

This is a very simple example using tensorflow to play super maior world.

## Materials

Emulator, game and libraries used in this project

### Emulator and Rom

-   [Snes9x (emulator)](http://www.snes9x.com): Snes9x is a portable, freeware Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) emulator. It basically allows you to play most games designed for the SNES and Super Famicom Nintendo game systems on your PC or Workstation; which includes some real gems that were only ever released in Japan.

-   [Super Mario World (rom)](https://romsmode.com/roms/super-nintendo/super-mario-world-404711): Super Mario World is a 1990 side-scrolling platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). The story follows Mario's quest to save Princess Toadstool and Dinosaur Land from the series antagonist Bowser and his minions, the Koopalings. The gameplay is similar to that of earlier Super Mario games: Players control Mario or his brother Luigi through a series of levels in which the goal is to reach the flagpole at the end. Super Mario World introduced Yoshi, a dinosaur who can eat enemies and gain abilities by eating the shells of Koopa Troopas.

### Python libraries

As a prerequisite it is necessary to install [Python 3.8.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the following libraries: . `pynput`, `opencv-python`, `pillow`, `pyscreenshot`, `numpy`, `pyautogui`

```dos
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pynput
pip install opencv-python
pip install Pillow==2.2.2
pip install pyscreenshot
pip install numpy
pip install PyAutoGUI
```

## Methods

1. Detect emulator window space
2. Agent's observation of the current environment 
  2.1 Capture screen and aplly filters
  2.2 Recognize score, life and time
3. An action provided to the environment
4. Amount of reward returned after previous action
5. Back to `Step 2`

### Window detection

Looking for the emulator window (dimension)

```python
# detect window name
# print(pyautogui.getAllTitles())
windows_name = 'Super Mario World - Snes9x 1.60'

# mapping {title : PID}
wins_named = dict(zip(pyautogui.getAllTitles(), pyautogui.getAllWindows()))

# get window size
x = wins_named[windows_name].left
y = wins_named[windows_name].top
w = wins_named[windows_name].width
h = wins_named[windows_name].height

# box: x1, y1, x2, y2
# add padding (8, 52, 8, 10)
dimension = (x+8, y+52, x+w-8, y+h-10)
```

Window with original values and window by padding

  <img height="320" src="images/window_capture_pad.png">
</p>

Click on the window to select

```python
pyautogui.mouseDown(x + w / 2, y + h / 2)
time.sleep(0.2)
pyautogui.mouseUp()
```

### Screen capture

Example screenshot of game and applying filters

```python
size = get_screen_dimension()
image = ImageGrab.grab(size)
image = numpy.array(image)
image = cv2.resize(image, (0,0), fx = 0.25, fy = 0.25, interpolation=cv2.INTER_CUBIC)
image = cv2.Canny(image, threshold1 = 100, threshold2 = 200)
```

The figures below show: original screen capture, resize and Canny filter

  <img height="240" src="images/image_before_filter.png">
  <img height="240" src="images/image_after_filter.png">
</p>

### Simulate the keyboard

Default play keys set in emulator

Key mapping in code

```python
keys = [
    Key.up,                                 # UP
    Key.down,                               # DOWN
    Key.left,                               # LEFT
    Key.right,                              # RIGHT
    pynput.keyboard.KeyCode.from_char('x'),  # A
    pynput.keyboard.KeyCode.from_char('z'),  # B
    pynput.keyboard.KeyCode.from_char('s'),  # X
    pynput.keyboard.KeyCode.from_char('a'),  # Y
    pynput.keyboard.KeyCode.from_char('d'),  # L
    pynput.keyboard.KeyCode.from_char('c'),  # R
    Key.enter,                              # START
    Key.shift_r,                            # SELECT
]
```

Example of use key DOWN (index = 1)

```python
# Initialize keyboad
keyboard = Controller()

# Use keyboard
keyboard.press(keys[1])
time.sleep(0.2)
keyboard.release(keys[1])
```
