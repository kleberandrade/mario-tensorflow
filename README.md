### Emulator and Rom

*   [Snes9x (emulator)](http://www.snes9x.com): Snes9x is a portable, freeware Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) emulator. It basically allows you to play most games designed for the SNES and Super Famicom Nintendo game systems on your PC or Workstation; which includes some real gems that were only ever released in Japan.

*   [Super Mario World (rom)](https://romsmode.com/roms/super-nintendo/super-mario-world-404711): Super Mario World is a 1990 side-scrolling platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). The story follows Mario's quest to save Princess Toadstool and Dinosaur Land from the series antagonist Bowser and his minions, the Koopalings. The gameplay is similar to that of earlier Super Mario games: Players control Mario or his brother Luigi through a series of levels in which the goal is to reach the flagpole at the end. Super Mario World introduced Yoshi, a dinosaur who can eat enemies and gain abilities by eating the shells of Koopa Troopas.

### Window detection

Looking for the emulator window (dimension)

```python
# detect window name
# print(pyautogui.getAllTitles())
windows_name = 'Super Mario World - Snes9x 1.60'

# mapping {title : PID}
wins_named = dict(zip(pyautogui.getAllTitles(), pyautogui.getAllWindows()))

# get window size
x = wins_named[windows_name].left
y = wins_named[windows_name].top
w = wins_named[windows_name].width
h = wins_named[windows_name].height

# box: x1, y1, x2, y2
# add padding (8, 52, 8, 10)
dimension = (x+8, y+52, x+w-8, y+h-10)
```

Window with original values and window by padding

</p>

Click on the window to select

```python
pyautogui.mouseDown(x + w / 2, y + h / 2)
time.sleep(0.2)
pyautogui.mouseUp()
```

### Game input

Default play keys set in emulator

key mapping in code

```python
keys = [
    Key.up,                                 # UP
    Key.down,                               # DOWN
    Key.left,                               # LEFT
    Key.right,                              # RIGHT
    pynput.keyboard.KeyCode.from_char('x'),  # A
    pynput.keyboard.KeyCode.from_char('z'),  # B
    pynput.keyboard.KeyCode.from_char('s'),  # X
    pynput.keyboard.KeyCode.from_char('a'),  # Y
    pynput.keyboard.KeyCode.from_char('d'),  # L
    pynput.keyboard.KeyCode.from_char('c'),  # R
    Key.enter,                              # START
    Key.shift_r,                            # SELECT
]
```

Example of use key DOWN (index = 1)

```python
# Initialize keyboad
keyboard = Controller()

# Use keyboard
keyboard.press(keys[1])
time.sleep(0.2)
keyboard.release(keys[1])
```
